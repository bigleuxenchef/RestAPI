Disclaimer 

I am interested in testing technologies and the best way is to do it yourself and experiment. Just do what others did already is a way to learn.

This site does not pretend to teach anything to anyone, this has been my way to keep my personnal stuff on a cheap share/cloud repository. I am happy to share with anyone.
