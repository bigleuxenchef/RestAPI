Disclaimer

I am interested in testing technologies and the best way is to do it yourself and experiment. Just do what others did already is a way to learn. This is why I posting what I have done by myself without any pretending to invent or teach anything to anyone.

Happy to share with anyone, happy anyone takes a copy, but I would recommend not to use any of this material as it is more for personal experiment than to achieve anything special other than learning.

# Jersey Rest API

## Introduction

Need to master eclipse very well : it helps a lot.

I have started by using the website <http://crunchify.com/how-to-build-restful-service-with-java-using-jax-rs-and-jersey/>
This website was not only useful in helping integrating not only all the pieces together but it explain well as well how to start with the IDE.
I pretty much follow step by step and it was it!



## Eclipse fast track

Able to navigate well on eclipse, maven and linux is greatly appreciated.


## it runs

Tested with Tomcat 7.0 and Tomcat 8.5 : using different deployment mode
