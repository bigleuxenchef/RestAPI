Disclaimer

I am interested in testing technologies and the best way is to do it yourself and experiment. Just do what others did already is a way to learn. This is why I posting what I have done by myself without any pretending to invent or teach anything to anyone.

Happy to share with anyone, happy anyone takes a copy, but I would recommend not to use any of this material as it is more for personal experiment than to achieve anything special other than learning.


#MyRestSTS (Spring Tool Suite)

###IDE Eclipse

This sample uses Spring STS from Eclipse (installed from MyMarketplace). Spring can be shipped with a full eclipse IDE that has been re-looked for spring. Here everything has been done using Eclipse Neon 2 from scratch
